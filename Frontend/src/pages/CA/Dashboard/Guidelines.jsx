          Greetings Ambassadors of Zeitgeist, <br />
          <br />
          Welcome to the vibrant world of Zeitgeist, where creativity and
          passion collide to create a cultural extravaganza like no other. As
          the chosen torchbearers of our annual festival, you have a pivotal
          role in shaping its success. This year, we're excited to introduce
          refined guidelines that not only uphold the essence of our mission but
          also empower you to take the spotlight and amplify the spirit of
          Zeitgeist. Your commitment to these guidelines will not only magnify
          your impact but also contribute to the legacy of this festival. <br />
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The most important part of your job is to spread awareness in your
            college regarding zeitgeist and to help ensure maximum participation
            in its events. This will be primarily done by sharing the posts from
            our Instagram/LinkedIn/Twitter page on your stories/feeds and to the
            other groups of your college students on those platforms. The same
            can also be done through WhatsApp groups, but make sure you've
            already shared the posts on Instagram.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your role is to maximise the number of visits to our website along
            with bookings of the festival tickets(as soon as the registrations
            begin). This task will put your communication and convincing skills
            to test, thereby being the most important rewarding task. As soon as
            you register for the CA program, you will be assigned your
            respective referral code which can be filled by customers while
            purchasing tickets indicating that they've been enlightened or
            encouraged by you to do so. Each registration done along with your
            referral code with reward you with hefty points.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are requested to approach the cultural clubs/societies of your
            respective colleges and encourage as well as incentivize them for
            participating in our events by bringing the hefty rewards to their
            notice. Approaching old participants regarding the same can also be
            an effective way to bring in more participants.
          </li>
          <li>
            It goes without saying that publicizing our social media handles by
            sharing their profile links throughout your college and personal
            groups will make you eligible for extra points based on each share.
          </li>
          <li>
            Several posters for all events will be released time to time on the
            Instagram and twitter page of Zeitgeist, which should be shared in
            different groups on Instagram as well as WhatsApp. All these
            activities carry weightage of points. You can report your work
            through sharing screenshots to your respective supervisor.
          </li>
          <li>

            be our official merchandise or of any other sponsor), it is
            mandatory to share it on your social media timelines/story along
            with tagging zeitgeist's official page.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will be required to print some posters (on an A3 sheet of paper
            or bigger) and paste them at various active and lively areas of your
            college like the cafeteria, mess, notice boards etc. For
            verification of your efforts, you need to make a short video (2-3
            seconds) that portrays the spot where you've pasted the poster and
            also the surroundings.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the time comes your assistance will be required to take
            necessary permissions from respective authorities concerning hostel
            affairs in your college for allowing our public relations team to
            conduct flash mobs, acts and publicity drives in your campuses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Checking your mail and WhatsApp regularly for the updates is
            mandatory.
